# SQLite Practice (Java)

This repository documents my learning journey with **SQLite in Java**, along with setting up a proper **Maven** project and transitioning from **VS Code to IntelliJ IDEA**.

## What I Learned

* Connecting Java to SQLite using **JDBC**
* Creating tables and performing **CRUD operations**
* Using **PreparedStatement** safely
* Handling `ResultSet` correctly
* Understanding deletes (including basics of cascading deletes)

## Tooling & Workflow

* Project managed with **Maven**
* First-time proper use of **Git** (`clone`, `commit`, `push`)
* Connected GitHub repository directly to **IntelliJ IDEA**
* Pushing commits from IntelliJ instead of VS Code

## Current Features

* Create `users` table
* Insert users
* Read all users
* Delete users by ID

## Tech Stack

* Java
* SQLite
* JDBC
* Maven
* IntelliJ IDEA

This repo reflects steady progress from fundamentals to real-world Java database workflows.
